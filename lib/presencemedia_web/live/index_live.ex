defmodule PresencemediaWeb.IndexLive do
  @moduledoc """
  The presence app, rebuilt on a layout system.

  This is the same surface HomeLive carries, with the same behaviour and the
  same hooks — the difference is entirely in how it is MEASURED. HomeLive grew
  by accretion: a `max-w-6xl` on one box, a `w-[32rem]` on another, `px-4` on
  the container, `px-[1.95rem]` on the rows, `px-1` on the tags, and a bar sized
  `calc(min(100vw,72rem)-2rem)` to escape a parent narrower than itself. Five
  left edges, and a mark that had left all of them for the viewport edge.

  Here there is ONE bound and ONE rail, declared in app.css under "THE APP
  SHELL" and worn by every band of the page:

      .rail  →  max-width: --app-max, centred, --app-gutter either side

  THERE ARE EXACTLY TWO LEFT EDGES, and knowing which is which is the whole
  design:

    THE RAIL is STRUCTURE — the app's outer bound, which nothing crosses. It is
    where a FILL begins (the band's wash) and where a trailing box ENDS (the
    frame, the counts). No word sits on it.

    `--list-pad` is TEXT, one step in. Every word on the surface starts here:
    the mark, the line, the row labels, the band's own label. Rows and the band
    sharing it is what keeps a row's label exactly on top of the band's as it
    passes through, and the mark and the line joining them is what stops the
    app's furniture reading as pressed flat against the bound.

  So the split is not page-versus-list, it is structure-versus-words — which is
  why one number governs every text on the page and moving it moves them
  together.

  The two lenses belong to NEITHER level, because they are not the page's
  furniture and not a heading for the list — they are the SELECTION BOX's own
  controls. So they hang off the box: immediately under the band, ending on its
  right edge. Right is the only side that works, since everything below the band
  is live scrolling list and row labels are short and left-aligned, leaving that
  strip reliably clear.

  Collapsing those two into one was the earlier mistake in both directions: the
  old surface gave the MARK the list's inset (making it look like a list
  heading), and the first cut of this one took the inset off the ROWS (flattening
  them against the page edge). They are different things and are now measured
  separately. Nothing can reach the viewport either way, because the rail is the
  outer bound and the list lives inside it.

  The data lives in `Presencemedia.Directory`, so this file is about the surface
  and nothing else.

           It is absolute so it cannot push the body down and move the band with
           it — the band's placement is the one piece of geometry this screen is
           built on — but it wears the same .rail inside, which is what puts it
           on the same left edge as the line, the tags and the rows below.

           A BUTTON, not a link: home is this page, so the click had nothing to
           point at. It flips the theme and replays its own entrance doing it, so

        </p>

        <%!-- THE STAGE. This box spans the RAIL, not the list column, and that
             is the fix for the old surface's worst joint: the bar used to live
             inside a 32rem parent while being wider than it, so its width was
             written as calc(min(100vw,72rem)-2rem) — the page's measure spelled
             out a second time, in a second place, free to disagree. Here the bar
             is simply inset-x-0 of a box that already IS the rail, and the list
             column is a child of it. One measure, stated once.

             Its height comes from the scroller inside it (the bar is absolute
             and adds none), which is what lets the bar's top:34% and the band
             the hook measures at 34% of the scroller be the same line. --%>
        <div class={["relative mt-12 min-h-0 w-full flex-1", @mode == :open && "list-away"]}>
          <%!-- phx-update="ignore": the hook marks the focused row with a class
               and a patch must never wipe it. THE ID CARRIES THE MODE, because
               on an ignored element a new identity is the only way to swap the
               rows underneath — that is what lets three lists share one
               scroller and one band. Anything keyed on this element in CSS must
               therefore use the CLASS, never the id. --%>
          <%!-- THE SCROLLER IS A DIRECT SIBLING OF THE BAR, and must stay one.
               The rules that reveal the "--" placeholder and the FRAME are
               written `.scopes-scroll.has-selection ~ .bar .frame` — the hook
               owns the scroller (it is the one element LiveView will not touch)
               and marks the selection there, and the bar reads it across. Wrap
               this in a column div for tidiness and the `~` stops matching: the
               frame silently never appears. The column width lives on the
               scroller itself for exactly that reason. --%>

            <ul>
              <%!-- The row carries its own frame as DATA, not markup: one
                     shared frame reads these on settle, so nineteen rows cost
                     nineteen attributes rather than nineteen media elements. A
                     country carries none — its answer is a headcount the server
                     renders, not a face. --%>

                       while the row is IN the band. It keeps its own muted
                       colour on purpose: the focused row turns terracotta, and
                       this staying grey is what stops the band reading as two
                       labels shouting. Only a scoped person has both a label and
                       a name — a stranger or a country is one word. --%>

          <%!-- THE TWO LENSES, hung off the SELECTION BOX itself rather than
               floating somewhere near it. They sit immediately under the band
               and end on its right edge, so they read as that box's own
               controls — which is what they are: they decide what the box is
               choosing between.

               RIGHT-ALIGNED IS LOAD-BEARING, not a preference. Everything below
               the band is live scrolling list, and rows would slide straight
               through a label parked there. Row labels are short and left-
               aligned against --list-pad, so the band's far right is the one
               strip of that column reliably empty — putting the tags there is
               what lets them touch the box without ever colliding with it.

               Offset is the band's half-height plus a hair, so the two stay
               welded however --band-top moves.

               TEXT, NOT CHIPS. A filled box reads as a control you press once
               and are done with; these are a pair you live in, and the lit one
               is the one you are inside. Colour alone says so — PRIMARY for
               where you are, muted for where you are not — the language the
               focused row and the band already speak. The location lens wears
               its PLACE as its name: "LOCATION FINLAND" said it twice. --%>

                 top of the label of whichever row is passing through it. Its
                 WASH starts at the rail, because the box is a block in the

                 styling — without it a patch strips the src the hook set and
                 stops a face mid-sentence. Its state is all in CLASSES for the
                 matching reason: on an ignored element LiveView still merges
                 data-* from the server's copy and deletes any the client added.
                 The frame is wholly client-owned, which is honest, since a

              <%!-- TWO IDENTICAL BOXES, and that is the point. They are the same
                   kind of thing — a population of this place, and a door into it
                   — so making one bigger or colder would rank them, and they are
                   not ranked. The scoped box keeps the frame's footprint and the
                   frame's right edge, because in this mode it is what the band is
                   pointing at: a place answers with numbers where a person
                   answers with a face.

                   What tells them apart is the BRACKETS, which sit on whichever
                   population you are currently in. That is the same job brackets
                   do everywhere here — they do not decorate a box, they aim at
                   the chosen one — so nothing new has to be learned to read
                   which of the two you are looking through. --%>

           What opens under the header once a relationship is picked up. A
           SIBLING of the list rather than a child, and fixed rather than in
           flow, because the list must keep its geometry while hidden — the bar
           is positioned against the list's box, so a collapsing container would
           drag the header off its own line mid-flight.

           TWO VIEWS, ONE ROOM: RECORD on the left is what this relationship
           LEFT — presences, held — and LIVE on the right is who is on the line
           right now. It wears the same .rail, so RECORD lands on the very edge
           the mark, the line, the tags and the rows all use. --%>
