defmodule PresencemediaWeb.RecorderLive do
  @moduledoc """
  A REFERENCE EXHIBIT, not a feature.

  This is the recorder UI from the earlier app, reproduced as markup so it can be
  looked at and argued with. There is deliberately no hook, no getUserMedia and
  no MediaRecorder — nothing here records anything. The original `phx-hook` is
  omitted on purpose so LiveView does not go looking for a hook that is not
  there.

  What IS faithful is the structure, because the structure is the invention. The
  behaviour notes on the page are read out of the original hook rather than
  guessed at, and the layer boxes are annotated so the mechanism is visible
  standing still — which a scroll-snap interface otherwise never is.

  ## The idea, as the original JS describes it

  Three scroll-snap layers stacked on one another, each 95% wide so the next one
  always peeks. Swiping is not navigation here — it is the TRANSPORT. Swipe
  distance past a threshold is what starts, pauses and switches the stream, so
  the same gesture that reveals a layer is the gesture that arms it.

  Delete this module the moment it has been mined for whatever it is worth.
