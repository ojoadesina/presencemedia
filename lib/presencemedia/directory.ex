  The people, the places, and the presences they left.

  FIXTURE DATA, deliberately. This app has no database and does not depend on
  Ecto: the surface is being designed before the spine is built, so nothing here
  is loaded, only rendered. The MEDIA is real, though — fetched from Wikimedia
  Commons at play time — so what you see behaves like the thing rather than
  miming it.

  It lives in its own module so a LiveView can be about the SURFACE. When the
  spine does arrive, this is the one file that changes and every view that reads
  it keeps working.

  # Wikimedia Commons serves a permanent MP3/WebM transcode alongside every
  # upload. We point at those rather than the .ogg and .webm originals for one
  # blunt reason: Safari cannot play Ogg Vorbis at all, and the originals are
  # 9–14 MB apiece for a screen that is forty-five pixels square. The 360p
  # transcodes are roughly a tenth of that.

  # A USER is a label YOU gave them, the name they came with, and what their
  # frame is currently carrying. The label leads because it is how you actually
  # think of them; the name follows, faded, and only once the row is in the band.
  #
  # STATE and FRAME are two different questions and are kept apart on purpose.
  # State asks about the PERSON and the line to them; frame asks what is coming
  # THROUGH it. The two are orthogonal, and every combination means something:
  #
  #   "absent"  — not reachable. The screen drains to neutral rather than to a
  #               paler terracotta, because terracotta is the colour of someone
  #               being there and a weak version of it reads as a weak signal
  #               rather than as nobody.
  #   "present" — reachable. The screen keeps its colour and sits still unless
  #               there is media to move it.
  #   "live"    — the line is open right now. The screen breathes EVEN WITH
  #               NOTHING COMING THROUGH, which is the whole point of the state:
  #               a live line with no voice and no face is still a live line,
  #               and a still screen could not say so. The frame breathes with
  #               it, on the same period, so the two read as one thing being
  #               alive rather than two things blinking.
  #
  # Absence pairs with an empty frame here for the obvious reason — you cannot
  # be away and talking — but nothing in the code enforces that, because a line
  # can perfectly well carry a recording of someone who has since gone. Live is
  # deliberately spread across all three frame modes below, so the empty case
  # that proves the state is worth having actually appears.
  #
  # FRAME is the state of the line to them, and it is deliberately three-valued
  # rather than a boolean, because "nothing coming through" and "audio coming
  # through" are different facts and the frame renders them differently:
  #
  #   "empty" — no signal. The screen sits still.
  #   "voice" — audio only. The screen breathes, because there is nothing to
  #             look at and the sound is the whole message.
  #   "face"  — video. The screen holds still and shows it.
  #
  # THE MEDIA IS REAL, and chosen to match what this app is for. The voices come
  # from Commons' Voice Intro Project, where people record a short introduction
  # of themselves — the closest thing to a real first contact that exists under
  # a free licence. The faces come from Wikitongues, whose recordings are single
  # speakers talking to camera. Every clip is under a minute. Licences run CC0
  # to CC BY-SA; attribution lives in ATTRIBUTION.md at the repo root.
