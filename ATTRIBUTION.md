# Media attribution

The fixture users in `lib/presencemedia_web/live/home_live.ex` point at real
media hosted by Wikimedia Commons. Nothing is vendored into this repo — the
browser fetches each file from `upload.wikimedia.org` at play time — but the
licences below still require attribution wherever the work is shown, so they
are recorded here.

Every clip is under one minute. We link Commons' generated transcodes rather
than the originals: Safari cannot play Ogg Vorbis at all, and the source WebM
files are 9–14 MB apiece for a screen that is forty-five pixels square.

## A note for whoever wires up the real thing

`upload.wikimedia.org` rate-limits aggressively and answers HTTP 429 with an
HTML body when hit hard without a descriptive User-Agent. Browsers loading one
clip at a time do not trip it; a test harness looping over every URL will.
