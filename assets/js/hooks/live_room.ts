// THE LIVE ROOM. A grid of the people whose line is open right now, and one
// set of brackets — the RETICLE — that glides between them, resting on whoever
// is speaking. That single moving frame is the whole idea: attention in a real
// room is one thing that moves, not every face outlined at once. Every call app
// boxes all of them; this one looks at whoever is talking.
//
// Here there is no microphone to listen to, so the speaker is chosen for the
// demo — a random one of the people who CAN speak (a voice or a face, never an
// open-but-silent line), held for a beat, then the reticle moves on. When the
// real signal exists, this is the one place that changes: pick by loudness
// instead of by dice, and the brackets already know how to fly.
//
// IT PAGES, because a room is not a list. Twenty open lines shrunk to fit one
// screen gives twenty faces too small to recognise, which defeats the point of
// showing faces at all. A page holds as many as can be seen properly — fewer on
// a phone — and the rest wait their turn. Paging happens HERE rather than on the
// server because the grid is phx-update="ignore": the server may not touch these
// rows without throwing away the playing videos and the reticle mid-flight.
