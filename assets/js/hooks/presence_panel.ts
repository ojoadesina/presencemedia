// THE PRESENCE PANEL. The relationship list's own mechanism, one level in: a
// band a third of the way down, presences scrolling THROUGH it, and whichever
// settles there is chosen. What is different is what "chosen" does. There is no
// frame off to the side — the chosen box IS the player.
//
// Two stages, so scrolling the list is never a wall of noise:
//
//   PREVIEW — a presence that lands in the band plays MUTED. A voice breathes
//   the box (the pulse is the play effect); a face shows silently at rest size.
//   Nothing is audible, so you can scroll through a whole conversation in peace.
//
//   COMMIT — clicking the chosen presence is what turns the sound on. A face
//   also grows to full height to be looked at properly; a voice just becomes
//   audible. There is no play/pause control anywhere — the row is the control.
//
// It reverts itself. When the media finishes, or the list moves under it, the
// box shrinks back and mutes again. Nothing keeps playing over a moving list,
// and nothing stays enlarged once it is done.
