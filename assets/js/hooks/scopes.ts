// THE SCOPES LIST. A fixed band a third of the way down the list is the
// selection: rows scroll THROUGH it, and whichever lands there is chosen. It is
// MODAL — the same scroller and band carry the people you hold (SCOPED), the
// people you don't (UNSCOPED), and a roll of countries (LOCATION); the server
// swaps the rows by changing the element's id, which re-runs this hook fresh.
//
// Selection resolves on SETTLE, not continuously — a highlight strobing past
// every row during a flick reads as noise, not as choosing. That single choice
// is what gives the line its rule too: the line and the marker ARE the settled
// choice made visible, so they leave the moment the list moves and return only
// once it has come to rest on a row.
//
// On settling, the nearest row PULLS ITSELF to the band's centre rather than
// sitting wherever the scroll happened to stop. A row only does that from
// within one row's reach; beyond that the band stands genuinely empty, which is
// what lets the list rest unselected at the top instead of magnetising the
// first row in.
